-> we have to use visual studio code for development.
-> zen of python (import this)
-> datatypes have methods and attributes
-> premited datatype we can make our own data types
-> datatype (set ,list ,taple ,dictionary) 
-> operation ,operator , operand
-> shallow copy (operand copy the addresses of the operands if the value of the operands are same)   
-> list will be hetroginus and arry will be homoginius
-> list []  we can update the value of list .sequence and index is important
-> tupel()  we canot update the valuse of the tuple.sequence and index is important
-> set{}
-> dictionary { with keys and values}                 no index and sequence meters ( we use key for data)key and value  
-> string operations
